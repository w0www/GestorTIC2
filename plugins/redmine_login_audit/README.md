## Feature

* Logs successful login attempts in Redmine
* Report successful login attempts in Redmine
* Can send email on successful login attempts in Redmine

## Roadmap

If anybody could be interested, the next features to implement would be:
* Filtering
* API logging

## Downloading and installing the plugin

First download the plugin using git, open a terminal in your Redmine installation directory:

```git clone git@github.com:martin-denizet/redmine_login_audit.git ./plugins/```

Then you will need to do migrate the database for the plugin.

``` bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production```

The installation is now finished and you will be able to use the plugin after you restart your Redmine instance.
