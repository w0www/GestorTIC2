  text_custom_workflow_before_save_note: You can change properties of the issues here. Do not create or update related issues in this script. To finish with error, use raise WorkflowError, "Message to user".
  text_custom_workflow_after_save_note: You can update or create related issues here. Note that this script will be also executed for the newly created issues. So make appropriate checks to prevent infinite recursion.
  text_custom_workflow_issue_code_note: Both scripts are executed in the context of the issue like ordinary before_save and after_save callbacks. So use methods and properties of the issue directly (or through "self"). Instance variables (@variable) are also allowed and may be used if needed.
  text_custom_workflow_shared_code_note: This code will run before any other workflow and may contain shared code, e.g. functions and classes needed by other workflows
  text_custom_workflow_user_code_note: Both scripts are executed in the context of the user object when user object changes. Use methods and properties of the user directly (or through "self")
  text_custom_workflow_group_code_note: Both scripts are executed in the context of the group object when group object changes. Use methods and properties of the group directly (or through "self")
  text_custom_workflow_group_users_code_note: These scripts are executed when user being added to group/removed from group. Use variables @user and @group to access appropriate objects in your scripts.
